    "The above example made use of HMACs which are one of the most commonly used MACs on the internet and can be found in the IPSec and TLS protocols for secure and authenticated communication over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hashed MAC (HMAC), or keyed-hash message authentication code, was invented in 1996 by Mihir Bellare, Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name indicates, a cryptographic hash function $H$ (such as MD5, SHA1, and SHA256) is used along with a secret symmetric key $K$ of general length of $512$ bits. 0s are appended to shorter keys. Longer keys can be hashed to obtain a shorter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/hmac.png\" width = 800>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind MACs is to attach a tag $H(K \\Vert m)$ for authentication to the message. This construct is however vulnerable to length extension attacks for hash functions. So we prepend $K \\oplus opad$ and hash again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice then computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $HMAC(m,K) = H((K \\oplus opad) \\Vert H((K \\oplus ipad)\\Vert m))$ \n",

    "where \n",
    "- $\\Vert$ indicates concatenation (for example, $X\\Vert Y$ denotes the string obtained by appending $Y$ to $X$ )\n",

    "- $K$ is the key, and \n",
    "- $H$ is a hash function.\n",

    "The inner- and outer- paddings are binary strings of length $512$ expressed in hexadecimal:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $opad = 5C5C5C\\dots5C$, $ipad = 363636\\dots36$\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using HMACs is that there is no need to modify the code of the hash function for the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the HMAC has been computed, it can be sent along with the message $m$ (which can be either encrypted or unencrypted) to the receiver, Bob. Since Bob also knows $K$, they can use the received message to compute $HMAC(m,K)$ again and to compare their result to the HMAC sent by Alice. If the two HMACs agree, the message can be assumed to be authentic and from Alice. This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By collision resistance, if $m$ gets altered to $m'$, $H(K \\oplus ipad \\Vert m')$ should differ from $H(K \\oplus ipad \\Vert m)$. As a result, $HMAC(m, K) \\neq HMAC (m', K)$. Hence, $HMAC(m,K)$ can be used to verify the integrity of the message received.\n",

    "## MACs vs Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "While MACs and Digital Signatures are both used to verify the authenticity of a message and, to some extent, its sender, they differ a lot when it comes to how they are structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of key\n",
    "\n",
    "MACs use a symmetric key system where both the sender and the receiver share the same key which is used for message authentication. On the other hand, with digital signatures, the key is tied to a person and each person signs the message they send with their unique key as a way of authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/MAC _vs_DS.jpg\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, Alice appends the message with a MAC using the key **k** which is then used by Bob to verify the integrity of the message and authenticate that it has been sent by someone on the communication channel. If Bob wanted to reply to the message they would use the same **k** to append a MAC to their message and send it to Alice. Hence, the key is shared between the sender and the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, with a digital signature, Alice sends the message signed by their **unique** signature which uses the key **k<sub>a</sub>**. This signature is used by Bob to verify both the authenticity of the message as well as ascertain that the sender is Alice specifically. If Bob were to reply to the message, they would sign their reply using their own **unique** signature which uses the key **k<sub>b</sub>**. As each sender has a separate key that is used to sign the message, the keys are not shared in the case of a digital signature.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since, as discussed before, for MACs to work, both Alice and Bob need to be aware of the key. This gives rise to the problem of how to share the key without Eve finding it. The key needs to be encrypted but it is not enough for Bob to receive a message that is encrypted sufficiently against intrusion. Bob also needs to authenticate that it is Alice that sent the encrypted message so Alice signs the message with their Digital signature that can be used by Bob to verify the authenticity of the message. Once Bob has the MAC key, all future communication can be securely authenticated using the MAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use MAC instead of always using Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of digital signatures, the security of the signature rests on its computational difficulty. Since the signature itself is made public, the only way to ensure that it is authentic is by making it unfeasible to reverse engineer the signing method (the **d<sub>a</sub> and the primes p and q** in case of RSA). It is this computational complexity that makes communication using digital signatures and public-key encryption so time and resource consuming. On the other hand, in the case of MAC or symmetric key encryption, The security is derived from keeping the structure and information regarding the key itself a secret rather than computationally complex. Thus, while communication with the key in hand is quick and resource-friendly, any intruder mustn't get to know any information regarding the key itself as it may not be that computationally complex to find the entire key from a part of it."

    "## MACs and Replay Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **replay attack** is one of the main challenges of key distribution. Eve may record/intercept a message from Alice and delay or resend it to Bob at a later time to trigger a response from Bob. Thus, we need a method to make sure that that each message is fresh.  This can be achieved in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sequence numbers*. A unique sequence number is attached to each message sent from Alice to Bob. If Bob ever sees the same sequence number again, they can conclude that the message received is a replay. Both Alice and Bob have to keep track of the sequence numbers which have already been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Timestamps*. Alice appends the current time to their message. To determine the validity of the message, Bob verifies that the included timestamp is within a predefined window of time. Both Alice and Bob need to have clocks set to the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Nonces*. Nonces are one-time, random messages used as part of a challenge-response mechanism. This mechanism involves Alice sending a message containing a nonce to Bob and requiring Bob to send back a correct response to Alice's nonce. Nonces sometimes include a timestamp for added security (but this again requires clock synchronisation).\n",
    "\n",
    "MACs use deterministic hash functions, and are hence vulnerable to replay attacks: if we have the same key and the same message, we send the same MAC. Since MACs do not incorporate any notion of state in their verification algorithms, we cannot check if the message is fresh. So, MACs alone cannot be used to defend against replay attacks but can be used in conjunction with the above methods."
